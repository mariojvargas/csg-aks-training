# Lab Environment

## Self-Guided or Classroom Setting

You will need the following in order to complete these labs:

* Azure subscription
* Linux, Mac, or Windows with Bash. However, Linux or Mac are recommended.
    > If you are following the labs using an Azure-provisioned Linux VM, please note that you won't be able to follow some of the labs. You can circumvent this by either installing a [Linux Desktop environment and enabling RDP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/use-remote-desktop).
* Docker
* Azure CLI
* Visual Studio Code
* Helm
* Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`)
* Git
* Optional: GitHub account

## Clone or Fork this Repository

It is recommended that you either clone this repository or fork it and modify as necessary.

If you clone this repository, create a directory called `repos` under your home directory (`~`). `cd` into that directory and clone from there.

> Our labs assume that this repository clone is in the `~/repos/cbus-aks-training` directory.

```bash
$ mkdir ~/repos

$ cd ~/repos

$ pwd
/Users/mvargas/repos

$ git clone https://github.com/mariojvargas/csg-aks-training.git
```
